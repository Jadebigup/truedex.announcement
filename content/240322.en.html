CFX:Conflux Network is a scalable decentralized blockchain network designed to achieve high throughput and fast confirmation. The consensus algorithm of Conflux Network is based on a special directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure called a tree graph. Unlike Ethereum, which only accepts transactions on a single chain into its ledger, a tree graph can merge and process transactions across all concurrent blocks. CFX is a native functional token of Conflux Network, used for network consensus, ecosystem incentives, network governance, and collateral.

CKB:Nervos is a layered blockchain network built from scratch, ensuring decentralization, security, and scalability through various layer 2 solutions. It prioritizes compatibility with different wallet solutions and interoperability with the ability to validate other blockchain consensus.
<p/>
NEAR: The NEAR protocol is a decentralized application platform designed to provide applications with similar availability as on today's networks. This network operates on a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Nightshade, aiming to provide dynamic scalability and stable transaction rates. Welcome everyone to truedex.io for trading!
