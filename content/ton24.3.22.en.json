    "content": "Dear user, TON/USDT trading pairs have now been officially listed on the TrueDEX exchange. Open Network (TON) is a scalable multi chain network that can process millions of transactions per second. TON is a native application and governance token for open networks. The existing blockchain lacks scalability and user-friendly interfaces. In addition, blockchains cannot communicate directly with each other. TON aims to address all of these issues through its multi blockchain architecture. TON blockchain is a collection of blockchains consisting of a main chain, up to 232 work chains, and up to 260 shard chains. The main chain of TON is the main blockchain, which contains all information about the protocol and current parameters. On the other hand, a work chain is a blockchain that processes smart contract transactions. These work chains are further fragmented. Through these shards, TON can instantly transmit messages between any two blockchains, regardless of network size, achieving fast and large-scale scalability. In addition, to address security issues and maintain decentralization, TON uses a proof of equity consensus mechanism and allows validators to add new blocks on top of any invalid blocks to avoid unnecessary forks. The TON ecosystem consists of blockchain products, such as decentralized storage, blockchain naming systems, micro payment platforms, and other decentralized services. TONCOIN has several use cases in this ecosystem, such as obtaining validation nodes and liquidity reward, voting on protocol proposals, and paying for TON products. Welcome everyone to truedex.io for trading!"
